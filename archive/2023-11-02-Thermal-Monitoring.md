When using a Thermal camera to alert on high/low temperature values, you may need to take ambient temperature variations into account.  This may be a challenge.  Also, the alarm area temperature thresholds may need to be adjusted based on ambient temperature changes.
A Node-RED flow with a dashboard is one solution to provide more control.
