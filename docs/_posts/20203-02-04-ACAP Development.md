Do you want to develop your own service running in an Axis Camera?  ACAP stands for Axis Camera Application Platform.  It is similar to App development for a mobile phone but  the difference is that while Apps are targeting users,  ACAP targets integrators.
In order to develop an ACAP you need to have basic understanding of C, HTML anf JavaScript.  You can find more information on [Axis Developer Community](https://www.axis.com/developer-community/acap).
