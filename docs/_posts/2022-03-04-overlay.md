Overlay is an MQTT client that other clients can publish message that will be shown in the video text overlay.  The default/standard camera overlay will not be affected.

## Prerequisite
1. Axis camera  
*Note that Overlay is only supported for cameras based on ARTPEC-7 and ARTPEC-8 platform*
2. [Overlay](https://api.aintegration.team/acap/overlay?source=pages) ACAP
3. A video player (e.g. VideoLAN or similar)

## Configuration
Configure the text overlay settings.  You can use the "Test text" while configuring.

Clear time will automatically clear the text after X amount of time.

## HTTP
If you do not have MQTT clients you can use HTTP to update the text.  
```
http://address/local/xoverlay/update?text=Hello%20World
```
You can copy the HTTP url bly clicking "Get HTTP link" and paste that into your HTTP client.

## MQTT
Connect to the broker.  Once connected you will see (or change) the topic the MQTT clients can publish a text string to.  By default the subscription includes the device serial number.  Change the topic to a generic topic if you have many cameras that should have the same text overlay.
