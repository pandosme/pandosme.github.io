title:  "Simplified Node-RED integration with Axis devices"

The integration API for Axis devices is based on HTTP and SOAP using [VAPIX](https://www.axis.com/vapix-library/) and [ONVIF](https://www.onvif.org/). 
Both API may be challanging to scripts to work with that may require a lot of trail-n-error.  Using Axis Node-RED Node simplifies scripting
as it wraps complexity and oddities in simple msg input and output.

## Installation
Go to your Node-RED directory (typical ~/.node-red).
```
npm install pandosme/nodered-axis-com
```

## Device Node
