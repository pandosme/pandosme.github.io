The integration API for Axis devices is based on HTTP and/or SOAP using [VAPIX](https://www.axis.com/vapix-library/) and [ONVIF](https://www.onvif.org/). 
Both APIs may be challenging to script around is they do require digging into the API documentation and a bunch of trail-n-error.  Using Axis Node-RED Node simplifies Node-RED scripting to Axis devices.

## Installation
Go to your Node-RED directory (typical ~/.node-red).
```
npm install pandosme/nodered-axis-com
```

## Device Node
Common use cases for generic devices.  Importable example flows
