Path is an MQTT client that installs in Axis camera and Axis Radar to capture an path data when an object moves through a scene.  It utilizes the video analyctics resources in the camera. When an object leaves the te scens (or when lost by the tracker), a message is published on MQTT. 

Examples of use cases:
* Flow heatmap
* Dwell heatmap
* Counting
* Forensic

# Prerequisite
1. Axis camera  
2. [Path ACAP](https://api.aintegration.team/acap/path?source=pages) ACAP
3. A system with an MQTT client that consumes and process the data for some use case  
4. Access to an MQTT Broker

# Validation
The configuration page displays the 15 most recent detections visually augement over video and in a table.  This can be used to optimize behaviour depending on scene.

# Settings

## Detection filter
Detected objects must comply to all the filters to be published.

\
**View and Set area object must pass**  
Click the button and use mouse to define the area. Defines the area that the object must pass while moving through the scene.  At least one path sample point must be within this area.

\
**Minimum distance**
Set how long the total movement distance must be to be published in percent of the view.  Use this to reduce small sporadic false detections.
\
**Path resolutions**
Defines how many samples will be taken. Medium is prefered.  For scenes where objects moves in a stright line, use Low.  For scenes where objects twists and turns, use High.
\
**Minimum age**
How many seconds object must be present in the scene.  Use this to reduce sporadic false detections.
\
**Object type**
Use with caution as the quility of object classification depends on the scene.  It is only recommended to apply this filter after a day of capturing has been analyzed.
\
**Camera placement**
Defince the center-of-gravity of the object that is used when checing if the object is passing the area-of-interest while moving in the scene.
Wall mounted cameras that result in a view with perspective the optimal center-of-gravity is bottom-center (the feet on a person)
Ceiling mounted cameras will place center of gravity in the middle-center of the object.

# MQTT Settings
Standard MQTT cient settings.  You may add optional properties in the payload to be used in systems with many cameras.

# Advanced
Depending on how tha camera is rotated, you may need to adjust the rotation 0, 90, 180 or 270 degree.
If there are motion detections in scene that may unwanted behavior in the results, adjust area where motion is ignored.  
One example may be scene with very long perspective view.  Adjust the "Set Motion detection area" to cut off detection before objects too far away.
Another example is if there are areas in the middle of the scene where objects do not use but small animals may.  Use "Set ignore area".


# Integration

## MQTT Topic:
```
path/DEVICE-SERIAL-NUMBER
```
If multiple cameras are used, subscribe to path/#

_Note that you can change the pre-topic "path"_

## payload:
* name: Friendly name, if defined under MQTT settings
* info: Additional information (e.g. location), if defined under MQTT settings
* device: Device serial number
* id: Object tracker ID
* timestamp: EPOCH number
* dx: Total distance moved X-axis (birth-death).  Negative values means left, positive right
* dy: Total distance moved Y-axis (birth-death). Negative values means up, positive down
* dwell: The longest time in seconds spend at a sample position
* age: Amount of seconds spent in scene
* distance: Total distance moved in scene.  THis can be more than 100% if object moves back/forth.
* path: Array of motion points in scene including x,y,d where d is duration in seconds spent in that position.
* type: Object type Unknown, Vehicle, Person
* class: "Object".  Future extension will include Human, Car, Bus, Truck, Motorcycle
* speed:  Highest speed in km/h.  Only applicable to Radar product.

Coordinate system is realtive [0,0] - [1000,1000] regardless of image aspect ration.  Origo is top-left corner of image.

# Things to consider
* Detection quality depends on scene, camera placement and light conditions
