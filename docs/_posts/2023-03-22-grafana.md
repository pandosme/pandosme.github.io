How can you visualize camera object counters in a graph?  
  \
This articles describes a recipe using MING (Mosquitto, InfluxDB, Node-RED and Grafana).  All are common services used in IT/IoT.

1. Mosquitto (MQTT) provides network transport of counter data from camera
2. InfluxDB provides the database storage of counters
3. Node-RED acts as a middleware that takes data from MQTT and injects it into the InfluxDB
4. Grafana provides the user interface that queries the InfluxDB and visualize the data in graphs

This solution deploys all these services with docker-compose.  You need to have a machine that can has [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) installed.  Instructions how to replicate is on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pandosme/ming-object-counter-graph) and/or, watch my [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/ihiN423nle4) how to setup.
