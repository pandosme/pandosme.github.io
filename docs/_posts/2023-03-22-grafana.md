How can you visualize camera object counters in a graph?  
  \
By using common IT/IoT services Mosquitto, InfluxDB, Node-RED and Grafana (a.k.a. MING stack).

1. Mosquitto (MQTT) provides network transport of counter data from camera
2. InfluxDB provides the database storage of counters
3. Node-RED acts as a middleware that takes data from MQTT and injects it into the InfluxDB
4. Grafana provides the user interface that queries the InfluxDB and visualize the data in graphs

Instructions how to replicate the solution with counters running on an Axis Device is found on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pandosme/ming-object-counter-graph).
