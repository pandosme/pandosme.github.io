Using the [DetecX ACAP Package](https://github.com/pandosme/DetectX) and trainging on the [Hagrid Hand Gesture Dataset](https://github.com/hukenovs/hagrid) supporting 18 hand gesture, this ACAP can detect them all.
This ACAP is still in Beta but works sufficiently well.

*Note: This ACAP will only wotk on ARTPEC-8 Cameras*
