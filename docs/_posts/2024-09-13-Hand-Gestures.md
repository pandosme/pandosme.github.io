Using the [DetecX ACAP Package](https://pandosme.github.io/acap/2024/09/04/Custom_Object_Detection_Models.html) and trainging on the [Hagrid Hand Gesture Dataset](https://github.com/hukenovs/hagrid) supporting 18 hand gesture, this ACAP can detect them all.
This ACAP is still in Beta but works sufficiently well.

*Note: This ACAP will only work on ARTPEC-8 Cameras*

Integrate by monitoring the events from camera or have the camera send MQTT on the event.
