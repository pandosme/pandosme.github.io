Detects various objects related tp PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) used to increase safty.  This ACAP is based on [DetectX](https://github.com/pandosme/DetectX), an open-source package. The model is trained on selected images from [SH17dataset](https://github.com/ahmadmughees/sh17dataset) dataset.  

*The model is trained mainly for demonstration and inspiration.  It has not been validated for production deployment. To say it bluntley, I have no idea how well the models perform.  I suspect that more work is needed to make it usabel* 

## Labels
Helmet, Person, Vest

*Note that the images below are based on the training data, not the actual detections* <br>
