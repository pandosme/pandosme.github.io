Recent firmware updates for Axis cameras include significant changes that affect ACAP (AXIS Camera Application Platform) services. Please be aware of the following:

## Impact on Applications

**Compatibility Issues**
- Some existing ACAP applications may become incompatible after firmware updates
- The Node-RED installer remains functional but requires updates for analytics bindings
- The Timelapse ACAP is undergoing redevelopment due to storage access changes

**Current Status**
- Migration work is in progress for affected applications
- Updates to existing ACAPs are being prioritized based on user needs
- New versions will accommodate the latest firmware requirements

## Recommendation
Before updating your device firmware, verify that your critical ACAP applications are compatible with the new firmware version. If you rely on custom ACAP solutions, maintain your current firmware version until updated ACAP versions are available and tested.
