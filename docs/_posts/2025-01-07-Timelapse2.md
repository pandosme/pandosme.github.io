Due to compatibility issues with Axis firmware 12, my popular ACAP TimelapseMe would not install. 
While attempting to maintain compatibility across multiple firmware versions, I had to develop a brand new application from the ground up - Timelapse 2.
This new version retains all the features from TimelapseMe while offering improved structure and enhanced user experience.

The application is now available as an open-source project on GitHub, allowing for community contributions and transparency in development.

**System Requirements:**
- Axis camera running firmware 11.11.x or later  
- Not compatible with earlier firmware versions. Use [TimelpaseMe](https://pandosme.github.io/acap/2020/01/01/timelapse.html)
