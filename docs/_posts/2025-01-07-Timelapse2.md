# Timelapse 2: Effortless Timelapse Videos on Axis Cameras

**Timelapse 2** is a modern, open-source application for capturing and creating timelapse videos using your Axis camera. Built for the latest Axis firmware, it’s simple to use—no programming required.

***

## Why Timelapse?

The most common use for timelapse on Axis cameras is **documenting construction site progress**—for example, capturing a photo at solar noon each day to visualize changes over time. But Timelapse 2 is flexible! You can use it for:

- **Any type of timelapse video**—nature, art, weather, and more.
- **Forensic motion event review**—capture images on motion detection, then quickly generate a timelapse for rapid video auditing of activity over long periods.

***

## Key Features

- **Flexible scheduling:** Capture images on a fixed schedule (like every day at noon) or trigger on motion events.
- **Efficient review:** Instantly turn months of images into a short timelapse video—perfect for quick audits and sharing progress.
- **Open Source & Community-Driven:** Transparent code, welcoming contributions and improvements from users.
