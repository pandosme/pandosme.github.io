If AOA (Axis Object Analytics) or the camera events already suits you needs, DataQ adds no value.  DataQ is an MQTT Client for Axis cameras that enables and simplifies custom data-driven solutions when standard camera data formats are insufficient. It processes, filters, and transforms data before MQTT publishing to optimize resource usage.
