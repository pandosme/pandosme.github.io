DataQ is an MQTT Client for Axis cameras that enables and simplifies custom data-driven solutions when standard camera data formats are insufficient. It processes, filters, and transforms data before MQTT publishing to optimize resource usage.  If AOA (Axis Object Analytics) or the camera events already suits you needs, DataQ adds no value.

## Data Types
### Events
Event-based triggers for actions, offering streamlined MQTT message publishing compared to standard Axis device capabilities.

### Object Analytics

**Detection Data**
- Real-time object detection
- Bounding box information
- Classification data
- High data throughput

**Tracker Data**
- Movement-based updates (and 2-second intervals)
- Direction, speed, and distance metrics
- Optimized bandwidth usage

**Path Data**
- Ideal for post-processing applications
  - Flow heatmaps
  - Dwell analysis
  - Forensic searching
  - Object counting
- Minimal bandwidth consumption and post processing needs

**Occupancy Data**
- Provides updates when number of detected objects in the scene changes
	- Que management
	- Loitering

### Monitoring Data

**Status Data**
MQTT Heartbeat published every 15 minutes
- Network load monitoring
- CPU usage tracking
- Uptime statistics


### [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/pandosme/DataQ)
The application is available as open-source project on GitHub, allowing for community contributions and transparency in development.
