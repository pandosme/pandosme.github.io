DataQ has been enhanced with GeoLocation capabilities, enabling the extraction of longitude and latitude data for detected objects. This new feature utilizes homography, a technique that maps 2D image coordinates to real-world geographic coordinates[5].

## Key Features

- **Homography Mapping:** Pairs four or more points in 2D coordinates with their corresponding world map longitude and latitude.
- **User-Friendly Calibration:** DataQ now offers a simple calibration process using mouse-based marker setting.
- **Validation Tools:** The user interface includes validation features to ensure accurate mapping.

## Applications

This GeoLocation extension opens up new possibilities for:

- **Object Tracking:** Monitor the real-world positions of detected objects.
- **Path Analysis:** Create flow heatmaps and conduct dwell time analysis[4].
