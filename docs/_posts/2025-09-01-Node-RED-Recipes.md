# Node-RED Recipes for Axis Cameras

This page presents a curated library of practical **Node-RED flows (or “recipes”) designed specifically for use with Axis cameras**. If you’re responsible for integrating, automating, or managing Axis devices—and even if you aren’t a full-time software developer—these recipes are meant for you.

**[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/)** is a powerful yet accessible platform, making automation with Axis devices easy for engineers, system integrators, and IT professionals. Each recipe below is ready to use or adapt for real-world scenarios.

## 📋 Recipes

- **[Enable/Disable WDR on Sunrise/Sunset](https://github.com/pandosme/node-red-recipes/blob/main/recipes/sunrise-sunset/README.md)**  
  _Automatically turns Wide Dynamic Range (WDR) on at sunrise and off at sunset, ensuring optimal image quality throughout different lighting conditions._

- **[Export SD Recordings to Local MP4](https://github.com/pandosme/node-red-recipes/blob/main/recipes/export-SD-recordings-to-local-MP4/README.md)**  
  _Fetches video recordings from Axis camera SD cards, saves them to local disk, converts MKV to MP4 format, cleans up stored videos on the camera, and maintains a local JSON index for easy access._

- **[Dashboard Camera Live Video and Object Analytics Visualization](https://github.com/pandosme/node-red-recipes/blob/main/recipes/dashboard-video/README.md)**  
  _Visualize live camera video and, optionally, analytic overlays in Node-RED dashboards._

- **[Thermal Monitoring and Alarm Adjustment](https://github.com/pandosme/node-red-recipes/blob/main/recipes/thermal-monitoring/README.md)**  
  _Node-RED dashboard for live video, tracking ambient temperature, and auto-adjusting alarm thresholds in Axis thermal cameras—a must for environments where alarm limits should follow ambient changes._
