# Node-RED Recipes for Axis Cameras

This page presents a curated library of practical **Node-RED flows (or ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù) designed specifically for use with Axis cameras**. If you‚Äôre responsible for integrating, automating, or managing Axis devices‚Äîand even if you aren‚Äôt a full-time software developer‚Äîthese recipes are meant for you.

**[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/)** is a powerful yet accessible platform, making automation with Axis devices easy for engineers, system integrators, and IT professionals. Each recipe below is ready to use or adapt for real-world scenarios.
