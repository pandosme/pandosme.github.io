**Having problems with annoying birds**

Turn any ARTPEC-8 or ARTPEC-9 Axis camera into an intelligent bird deterrent system. Annoying Birds detects crows, magpies, pigeons, seagulls, herons, and other nuisance birds in real-time—right on the camera, no cloud required.

When a bird enters your defined zone, the system triggers: speakers blast hawk calls, water sprayers activate, lights flash. Your backyard, rooftop, or garden stays protected. No manual intervention needed.

**Simple automation. Real results.**

- Runs entirely on-camera with edge AI
- ONVIF event and MQTT integration
- Create an automation with a speaker, light or water sprinkler

Sometimes the best solutions are the ones you don't have to think about. Install it, configure it, forget it—while your space stays bird-free.

Ready to set it up? The complete guide includes installation steps, MQTT topics, integration examples, and troubleshooting tips.
